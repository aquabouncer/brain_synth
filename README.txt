Largly I have no clue what I am doing like everyone else. But this project I have learned alot about music and the math behind it.
How all the notes are based on 440 hertz and every other note comes from that starting frequency.
Basic math that I had forgotten from not using it in forever.
I have tried my best to comment and label everything in a way that you can just read and go. 
This might be something that someone could inprove.
My hope is to give a cool sounding project for people to get experience Contributing to Github and help build up their work experience.
Do not be afraid to play and break the project you can always grab a new fork.
Experiment and have fun!
